        <p>Organizations are a big part of keeping the world's air clean. They use different techniques for making the

            problems. Here are some organizations that help with those things: </p>

        <p> They
            provide the people who have those problem with anything they need to keeps their lungs and breathing

        <p>If these organizations keep impacting the world, we the people will be healthier and have no problem
            breathing. Hopefully that will happen soon. If more and more places become polluted, then it will take a lot
            of effort and time to clean it up. Most likely at this rate it won't come to that. If you want to read more about this, then click the links at the bottom.</p>
