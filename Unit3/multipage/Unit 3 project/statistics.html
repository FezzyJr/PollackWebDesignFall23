        <p class="orangetext">Pollution has gone up a bunch over the years. The annual death rate has gone up because of
            the pollution. The
            ranges of the death are most starting in ages 50 and ending at 84. The deaths have gone up increasingly
            since then but some organizations are trying to stop it. If you want to read about that, click at the bottom
            link labelled: Organizations that help stop Air Pollution </p>
        <img id="airgraph2" src="airgraph2.png">
        <p>The organizations have done a fantasitc job cleaning the air. As you can see on the picture, the number of
            air pollution has gone down. You can also yourself stop air pollution by doing the following: drive less,
            don't smoke, don't burn fire for long periods of time, etc. If you do these things, you will help the earth
            in a small way but in a good way. As the years go on hopefully these number will go down even more to the
            point where everywhere the air will be clean.</p>
