        <p>Ever since we invented a new way to invent things using smoke or fire, the atmosphere has gotten more and
            more polluted. Most of the pollution is caused my factories who use heavy machinery that produce smoke. And
            every year more and more pollution is in the air and it keeps slowly growing more and more.</p>

        <p>Animals are suffering from these changes in the air. Before air pollution animals would live a life without a
            trouble of breathing. Now when air pollution is high, some animals are suffering cause of these changes. The
            pollution gets in their lungs and cause problems in their bodies. Air pollution also causes plants to die
